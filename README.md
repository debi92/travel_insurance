The best machine learning model produced is XGBoost with precision (0.079) and recall (0.385) for "Yes", ROC-AUC (0.769) and accuracy (0.913)

With this model, it is expected to be able to predict claims that will arise. So that it can avoid company losses and make consumers feel satisfied and will use Travel Insurance every time they travel.

For companies:
Provide online claim services
facilitate the claim process by using the machine learning model that has been created, then evaluate the predictions that have been made.
Provide special packages for the elderly by including health insurance
provide cheap packages for young people

For programmers/data scientists/data analysts:
Develop other more complex models
Collect further data on insurance prices (where some are 0 and some are very expensive, is there a specific basis)
Enter what coverage data is included
Enter the reason for the claim into the database for further analysis
